Sets whether `true` and `false` will show up as "true" and "false" or 1 and 0. In general a good setting to have as default.
    boolalpha
    noboolalpha

Will print a leading 0x or 0 for hex and oct numbers when used in conjuction with hex or oct formatters. Good to set it as default.
    showbase
    noshowbase

Should 1 be printed as 1.0? Good to set when doing numeric stuff, but not default.
    showpoint
    noshowpoint

Should 1 be printed as +1?
    showpos
    noshowpos

Used to control wheter leading whitespace should be stripped for inputs.
    skipws
    noskipws

Should a hex number be printed as 0x2a or 0X2A? Should scientific notation be printed as 1e-10 or 1E-10?
    uppercase
    nouppercase

Should output buffer be flused on every output?
    unitbuf
    nounitbuf

Used in conjunction with setfill/setw, determines whether the output is padded from the left or right.
    internal
    left
    right

Changes the base for integer I/O. Useful for printing out numbers in non-decimal format.
    dec
    hex
    oct

Controls how floating point numbers are printed.
    fixed => 0.000100 (only does 6 digits after decimal)
    scientific => 1.0e-4
    hexfloat => duh?
    defaultfloat => 0.0001

Strips leading whitespace from inputs.
    ws

Outputs NULL
    ends

Flushes the output stream.
    flush

Outputs NULL and flushes the output stream.
endl

Exactly how numpy.set_printoptions works.
    setprecision

Adds padding.
    setw
