    In the signature for area, we use &self instead of rectangle: &Rectangle.
    The &self is actually short for self: &Self. Within an impl block, the type
    Self is an alias for the type that the impl block is for. Methods must have
    a parameter named self of type Self for their first parameter, so Rust lets
    you abbreviate this with only the name self in the first parameter spot.
    Note that we still need to use the & in front of the self shorthand to
    indicate that this method borrows the Self instance, just as we did in
    rectangle: &Rectangle. Methods can take ownership of self, borrow self
    immutably, as weâ€™ve done here, or borrow self mutably, just as they can any
    other parameter.
